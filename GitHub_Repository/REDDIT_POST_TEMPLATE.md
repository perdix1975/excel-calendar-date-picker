Hi r/excel! 👋

I created a free Excel add-in that might save you some time if you work with dates.

**What it does:**
- Adds a large calendar button to your INSERT ribbon tab
- Press Ctrl+Shift+D to instantly open a visual calendar
- Click a date, it goes into your cell - formatted and ready
- Works with any date format (US, EU, etc.)

**Why I made it:**
Typing dates manually is error-prone and slow. I wanted something as simple as clicking a calendar - like you see in web forms.

**Features:**
✅ Visual calendar interface (175x215 pixels)
✅ Keyboard shortcut: Ctrl+Shift+D
✅ Auto-detects existing cell dates
✅ Auto-formats cells as dates
✅ Works completely offline
✅ 18KB file size
✅ No data collection, no tracking

**Download:**
GitHub: [Your GitHub Link]

**Requirements:**
- Excel 2013 or later (including Office 365)
- Windows 10+
- Takes 30 seconds to install (just double-click the .xlam file)

**Screenshots:**
[Upload to imgur.com and paste links here]
- Calendar dialog: [link]
- Ribbon button: [link]
- In action: [link]

**Installation:**
1. Download the .xlam file from GitHub
2. Double-click it
3. Enable macros when prompted
4. Restart Excel
5. Look for "Date Picker" in INSERT tab

Happy to answer any questions! Let me know if you find bugs or have feature suggestions.
